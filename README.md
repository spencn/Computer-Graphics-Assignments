# Computer Graphics Assignments
 Collection of graphics assignments done for a University course. See README

I do not claim to have written all the code. Within the A*.txt files I will have written which code snippets I added.
The parts of the assignments not marked were done by my great classmate.

Everything not outlined in those txt files will have been given by professor, either code they have wrote, or library files.

I believe A3 and 4 aren't 100% complete, we didn't get the chance to fully complete every assignment question, either due to time or difficulty. Maybe one day I will come back and relook at them. Computer graphics course was on of the more challenging courses I took, but very, very satisfying getting things to work.
