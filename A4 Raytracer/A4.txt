You are to add code to a raytracer to do the following:

  Russian Roulette

  Pixel antialising with jittering

  Soft shadows from area light sources

See "YOUR CODE HERE" in the provided code.  You should only have to
modify scene.cpp and scene.h.

After getting your code working, create an interesting scene that uses
these effects.  You may use digital models from elsewhere and may use
3D editors to create your scene.  If you do that, the objects will
have to be in Wavefront (.obj) format.  Note that not all Wavefront
objects are parsable by the code here.
